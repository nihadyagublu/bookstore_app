# Online Bookstore App utilizing public API

## A fully functional Front-end React project with interactive user interface that uses The New York Times Books API

The project uses a public API that shows the current The New York Times Best Sellers list and periodically updates the data. Visitors of the app can click the button to upload the list and choose an item that interests them. With that they can quickly look up to the details of the item and follow the Amazon link to actually make the purchase.

In Comments & Reviews section, visitors can easily express their opinions on the website and the books. To improve user experience several different transitions and animations were built into the system. In the project it was also included:

- Axios and fetchAPI were used to carry out data related tasks
- React Router was utilized to enable client side routing
- Transition Group library was used to animate objects
- Both plain CSS and CSS modules were utilized to give styling
- React Portals were created to render backdrop and error modal into the different parts of the DOM
- Firebase Realtime Database was used to store and demonstrate user input
